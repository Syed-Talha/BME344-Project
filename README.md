BME344 Project - Optimization of the Depth of Hypnosis in General Anesthesia Using a PID Controller
By: Syed Talha, Kevin Zhu

Control system based on the model in the paper:
"Optimized PID Control of Depth of Hypnosis in Anesthesia" by Padula et. al., 2017

The project uses Simulink/MATLAB to model a PID Controller system.

To run the project, you need a directory with:

Test_Model.mlx

project.slx

define_variables.m
